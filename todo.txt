Create static furniture items that can be interacted with, but not picked up.
Create a use verb which can use items to interact with static furniture items.
Create active furniture items, like switches, which can be interacted with without using items.
Create a vocabulary of extended verbs which make the world feel more interactive, e.g. dance, sing, kick, weep
Set up a system for handling multiple items of the same type in a room, e.g. red key and blue key.
Set up some default message to react to commands which are not understood, e.g. known verb + unknown noun.
Set up some text effects to help with readability - perhaps progressively fade older commands?
Incorporate error messages as standard paras (rather than a different system). createPara could have a parameter for message type
Start with an intro screen to break players in
Refactor existing functions, like the pickUp and drop handler

Prop objects should have item slots if they are part of a class called a receptacle (e.g. receptacle property=true)
A user can put items there, and it will add to the description of the room. e.g. There is a red key on the table.
There is a red key in the door.


The problem with the drop loop is this: it picks up the item, which passes the first logic test, and does not reach the else ifs.

Construct language patterns? Eg. for open - "open door with key" = verb prop noun. Use key on door = Vern noun prop

**Make the AddToArray function also work for props, with a parameter for the chosen array**

Multi-purpose "loop through array and find item/prop" function?

Improve messages for nonsensical moves like "use gnome on door"

Handle multiple keys for the door
